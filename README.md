## Requirements to run locally

> Just in case if you ran into errors make sure you're using correct flutter & dart version. In order to support desktop build master branch is a requirement But Master branch is not stable so breaking changes happen on daily updates.

- Flutter master channel & Framework â€¢ revision `4019956fc8`

  - Run `flutter --version` to check it

- Follow these step to use correct revision version
  - Run `cd $FLUTTER_HOME` (where your flutter is installed)
  - Run `git checkout master`
  - Run `git checkout 4019956fc8`
- To enable desktop & web builds run the relevant command
  - Run `flutter --enable-web`
  - Run `flutter --enable-macos-desktop`
  - Run `flutter --enable-linux-desktop`
  - Run `flutter --enable-windows-desktop`
- Run `flutter doctor` this command will show you what dependencies you need to install.

## Scripts

- `mac.pub.dart`
  - MacOS app doesn't compile if you include firebase libraries in pubspec.
  - When you run `dart scripts/mac.pub.dart` this script it remove firebase dependencies from project's `pubspec`.
  - You can compile your app peacefully.
  - Make sure to run `dart scripts/mac.pub.dart restore` when you're done testing/compile for MacOS app.
  - With `restore` flag your `pubspec` will revert to it's original form.
- `vslaunch.dart`
  - execute `dart scripts/vslaunch.dart`
  - This script will make vscode configuration file with all of your connected devices.
  - You can live debug app on multiple devices at once from vs code.
  - Each device's debug logs on separate **DEBUG CONSOLE**.
  - Very useful for testing UI for multiple devices simultaneously.
