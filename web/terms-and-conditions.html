        <h1>Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>
        <p>
            By downloading or using InvMovie app, these terms will automatically
            apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them
            carefully before using the app. You're not allowed to copy, or
            modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way.
            You're not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app,
            and you also shouldn't try to translate the app into other
            languages, or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the
            trademarks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual
            property rights related to it, still belong to their respective
            owners.
        </p>

        <p>
            We are committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient
            as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes
            to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any
            reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without
            making it very clear to you exactly what you're paying for.
        </p>

        <p>
            The InvMovie app stores and processes movie reservation data locally
            on your device. It's your responsibility to keep your phone and
            access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do not
            jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing
            software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official
            operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable
            to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone's
            security features and it could mean that the InvMovie app won't work
            properly or at all.
        </p>

        <h2>Third Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            The app does use third party services that declare their own Terms
            and Conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Link to Terms and Conditions of third party service providers used
            by the app:

        <h2>Internet and Network Usage</h2>
        <p>
            You should be aware that there are certain things that we will not
            take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require
            the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be
            Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but we cannot
            take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if
            you don't have access to Wi-Fi, and you don't have any of your data
            allowance left.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you're using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should
            remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network
            provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your
            mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the
            connection while accessing the app, or other third party charges.
        </p>

        <h2>App Updates</h2>
        <p>
            We may wish to update the app from time to time. The app is
            currently available on Android – the requirements for the system may
            change, and you'll need to download the updates if you want to keep
            using the app. We do not promise that we will always update the app
            so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android version
            that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to
            always accept updates to the application when offered to you.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes to Terms and Conditions</h2>

            are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We
            will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and
            Conditions on this page.
        </p>
